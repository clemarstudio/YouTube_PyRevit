# YouTube Python x BIM Lessons 🎥🐍

Welcome to the official repository of [Clemar Studio](https://www.youtube.com/@ClemarStudio)!  
This repo contains all the source codes, scripts, and learning materials from my **Python x BIM YouTube tutorial series**.

🚀 **Goal**: Help BIM professionals (even without a computer science background) learn how to automate tasks with **Python**, saving time and boosting productivity.

## 📺 About My Channel
On my channel [Clemar Studio](https://www.youtube.com/@ClemarStudio), I teach:
- Beginner-friendly **Python automation** for BIM workflows
- **Revit add-in development** using PyRevit
- **Navisworks add-in development** for automation
- **Standalone Python software** for BIM data processing and analysis
- Step-by-step tutorials using my **Fun Flow Formula**:
  1. **Concept Map** – Understand the workflow visually (no code yet).
  2. **Glue Code** – Use prepared Python snippets to get instant results.
  3. **Deep Dive** – Break down and explain how everything works in detail.
- Real-world BIM automation examples from my 60+ professional plugins and tools.

💡 I believe anyone can create BIM automation—even if you’re not from a programming background.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized by content type:
